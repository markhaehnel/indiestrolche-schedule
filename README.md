# Indiestrolche Schedule

Shows the Indiestrolche schedule of the current week based on their Twitch schedules.

## Usage

Requirements:

- node.js 18 or greater
- redis

Before you can run the application, you need to set your Twitch client secret and client id in the .env file.

```bash
# Copy .env.example to .env
cp .env.example .env
```

Adjust the values of `TWITCH_CLIENT_ID` and `TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET` to match the ones you got from the Twitch dev console.
